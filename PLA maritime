Turning PLA into material for boats is a complex process due to PLA's susceptibility to moisture absorption and degradation in marine environments, but advancements in PLA-PHA composites and incorporating waste materials offer potential for maritime applications, such as marine debris reuse or high-performance composites, although it requires further study and development for practical and durable boat components. 
Understanding the Challenges of PLA in Marine Environments

    Moisture Absorption:
    PLA's ability to absorb water can lead to swelling and embrittlement, reducing its mechanical strength and lifespan in marine conditions. 

Biodegradation:
While its eco-friendly nature is an advantage, PLA's potential to biodegrade too quickly in seawater can make it unsuitable for long-term use in maritime structures. 

Potential Solutions and Emerging Applications

    PLA-PHA Composites:
    Combining PLA with Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) can improve the material's performance in marine environments by offering a balance of biodegradability and better mechanical properties. 

Marine Waste as a Resource:
Researchers are exploring the use of marine plastic waste as a source material to create new filaments for 3D printing, offering a sustainable solution for both pollution reduction and material sourcing in the maritime sector. 
Green Composites:
Incorporating agricultural or marine waste into PLA to form green composites can reduce costs and enhance biodegradability without significantly compromising mechanical performance. 

Current Research and Future Prospects

    Accelerated Aging Models:
    Studies are developing models to predict the lifespan of 3D printed PLA components under marine conditions, a crucial step for understanding their long-term viability. 

Mechanical Degradation Studies:
The behavior of 3D printed PLA in simulated seawater environments is being studied to identify mechanical weaknesses, such as a decrease in ductility and yield strength, and to understand the effects of environmental factors on its performance. 
Sustainable Manufacturing:
3D printing is being recognized as a promising tool for cleaner production in the maritime industry, with the potential to produce components from recycled and bio-based materials.
