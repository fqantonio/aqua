The idea of building a small catamaran as an educational project to teach robotics and engineering is exceptionally valid and full of potential. 
Here's a detailed analysis, with specific nuances for the Portuguese context:

Project Advantages:

    Practical and Engaging Learning:
        This project provides a practical and dynamic experience, allowing students to apply theoretical robotics and engineering concepts in a real-world scenario.
        Students can acquire knowledge in design, construction, electronics, programming and mechanics, all integrated into a single project.
    Multidisciplinarity:
        The project covers several areas of knowledge, such as physics (hydrodynamics, stability), maths (design calculations, geometry), electronics (sensors, actuators) and programming (control of the catamaran).
        This fosters the development of transversal competences and an understanding of the interconnection between different disciplines.
    Development of Essential Skills:
        The project stimulates the development of crucial skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, critical thinking and creativity.
        Students learn to plan, design, build, test and optimise the catamaran, facing challenges and finding innovative solutions.
    Motivation and interest:
        Building a catamaran is a stimulating and motivating project, capable of arousing students' interest in robotics and engineering.
        The possibility of seeing the catamaran sailing and working is a rewarding experience for the students.

Important Considerations in the Portuguese Context:

    Adjusted Complexity:
        It is essential to adapt the complexity of the project to the level of knowledge of the students, taking into account the Portuguese school curricula.
        For beginners, you could start with a simple catamaran, with basic functions, and gradually add more advanced features.
    Safety First:
        Safety must be a priority at every stage of the project, especially in Portugal, where safety regulations are strict.
        It's crucial to provide students with the necessary personal protective equipment and to supervise construction and testing activities.
    Resources and Partnerships:
        Building a catamaran requires material and financial resources.
        It is important to seek partnerships with local companies, universities and research centres to obtain technical and financial support.
    Utilising the coastline:
        Portugal has a vast coastline, which makes this type of project particularly relevant.
        The use of renewable energies, such as solar energy, to power the catamaran can be explored, in line with current environmental concerns.

Exploration possibilities:

    Advanced Robotics:
        Implement sophisticated automatic control systems, such as autonomous navigation with GPS, speed control and steering with artificial intelligence.
        Use sensors to collect environmental data relevant to Portugal, such as water temperature, salinity and wave strength.
    Cutting-edge engineering:
        Explore different hull designs and propulsion systems to optimise the catamaran's performance in Portuguese waters.
        Using composite materials and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, to build the catamaran.

In short, the construction of a small catamaran is a valuable educational project suited to the Portuguese context, which can provide a rich and meaningful learning experience for students, while promoting the development of essential skills for the future.
