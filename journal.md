## July ##

idea: build a small catamara (1,2 m) to be used on maritime training and research. It should be 70% sustainable from A to Z. It should use 3D printing with new materials, more environmentally friendly.

Glueing the parts at the António Narçal workshop.
Workshop overview!

We are using the bodyboard as a testing for all of the processes.

Resin the hulls. Because of the weather its was a very slow process. 
We never reach the minimum temperature of 21 degrees and 60% of humidity.

As youu can see, there is a chemical reaction between the resin and the paint. The good news is that, if you repaint, it will vanishes! great!!!

Fill the holes and repaint after sanding, sanding and sanding. Repaint again. This process is not going well because it continues to react showing spots of orange (see pictures). We think to change the process in order to have more 3D printed only and putting the UV paint only. It avoids a lot of work and mess.

## April ##

In April we finnaly concluded the painting.

We did the UV paint with this brand.

The process is not environmentally friendly as we suspected: so, we plan to produce this catamara in a different way by taking the 3D printing strategy further, meaning that, we do not wanted to add to much to the 3D printing process, just the UV painting, and we want to assume the 3D printing "anommalous" desing by not be embarassed because of this consequent strange design. We will not 

## May ##

Spaghetti time. Designing the wiring and accomodating the hardware to control the AQUA.

We are also looking the way to adjust, with flexible material, the front and rear bars that go inside the boat. They are connected by two screws in each side.

Future: looking forward to test it in a pool.
