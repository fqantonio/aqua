# RESUME
Aqua is a small autounomous vessel for research and aquatic engineering learning. 
This project pretends to considerer to be envitronmentaly sustaible from start to end: meaning that,
all the steps, from fabrication to the end of life, should be environmentally freindly. This team values should
always be under the 4R's and circular economy principles, at least to a 70% degree.

The catamarã is a 1,2 m long and it pretends to be used in inside waters in good weather conditions. It is autonomous and carries a structure to transport sensores and gather local information of physical and chemical parameters.

> Portugal is 97% water

Because of this fact, we think that Portugal should set this strategy as a major footprint: taking care of the sea by knowing about it and defende it as an asset for the long future.

# HISTORY
This starts in the [FAB ACADEMY 2019](https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/fct/students/antonio-gomes/), as the final [incompleted] project, at the [FCT FAB LAB](https://www.fctfablab.fct.unl.pt/), Filipe Silvestre as the local instructor and Luís Carvão as the node instructor, course coordenated by the [FABACADEMY](https://fabacademy.org/), by professor Neil Gershenfeld.

Since then, we've supported two catamarans made by our intership (Guilherme Cruz) and by the Lab Aberto team where we were the winners of 2018 Sunset Hackathon. At this moment we gather. informally, a few experties of different areas to develop a project that need time to set the hulls on the water.

This project is documentend as journal in the file with the name "AQUA journal".

# STATE OF THE ART

At this moment we are finnishing the hulls by painting in a process that is not environmentally friendly as we suspected: so, we plan to produce this catamara in a different way by taking the 3D printing strategy further.
