- Check the site permissions to test/use the AQUA;
- Materials check list: computer; trolley; wooden platform to load the AQUA in the vehicle; box (roap; fenders; basic tools; USB cables; aqua battery charger; AA batery charger; AA batteries charged; multimeter charger monitor; telemetry radio; Radio Control transmitter);
- Check the Radio Control (RC) battery levels;
- Charge the AQUA batteries;
- Charge the portable computer bateries (the automatic shut down should be "never");
- Dinghy boat (if possible);

# DURING OPERATIONS

## PREPARE the MISSION
- MANUAL or AUTO mode?

- Available team (ideal four people): radio control, logistics, put and remove the AQUA from water and control of obstacles in the operating environment, computer warnings and data check, and auto mode or guided GPS way points operation;

## START

- Start the report;
- Connect the telemetry radio to the USB C in the computer;
- Turn on the computer and open MP;
- open the yellow cover on the starboard float by rotating it;
- Turn on the main power switch (see picture: put picture here!?!?!?): ear the sound saying that the hardware is waiking up;
- Turn on the hardware safety motor switch (picture here?!?!?!?): two sounds for each motor: it will change from blinking to solid light and emit two tones indicating initialization;
- Turn on the RC: (green led in the receiver that is only possible to see if the cover is open: changing from blinking to solid red);
- In the RC put the throtle in the middle position;
