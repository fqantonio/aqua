# RADIO transmiter
Follow this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRmlNQ3M3zE) for the binding process or this link (https://manuals.plus/flysky/fs-ia6b-receiver-2-4g-6ch-with-double-antenna-manual);

Notice that, if your radio receiver is already binded with another transmitter then you just have to plug the power and the shunt (black) as in the picture and remove the power once and plug again and the led will blink faster, meaning that the receiver is ready to bind. After this you follow the procedure of the video or the webpage above.
