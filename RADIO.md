# RADIO transmiter
To configure the radio transmitter to **manualy control** de boat by radio, follow this text (https://ardupilot.org/rover/docs/common-radio-control-calibration.html) and then this one for the boat, where you only change the FRAME_CLASS parameter to 2 (https://ardupilot.org/rover/docs/boat-configuration.html).

For the **binding** process, follow this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRmlNQ3M3zE) or this link (https://manuals.plus/flysky/fs-ia6b-receiver-2-4g-6ch-with-double-antenna-manual);

Notice that, if your radio receiver is **already binded** with another transmitter then, you just have to plug the power and the shunt (black) as in the picture and remove the power once and plug again and the led will blink faster, meaning that the receiver is ready to bind. After this you follow the procedure of the video or the webpage above.
